LeeesBungeeQueue is a 2b2t like queue plugin for Bungeecord
very easy to configure just make sure you have these things on bungeecord
or waterfall set properly below

in priorities make sure you have the name of the Main server where the map that people play on is
if your server is cracked make it the auth servers name instead

```
please note only use the plugin
with main or auth in priorities if
you have alwaysqueue set to false other wise
make the only server in priorities the queue server
EXAMPLE PREMIUM SERVERS:
priorities:
  - Main

EXAMPLE CRACKED SERVERS:
 priorities:
  - auth
  
  
 If you have alwaysqueue set to true
 which it is set to by default then make
 sure you have this set like this
 priorities:
 - queue

also make sure this is set to true
force_default_server: true

How to configure LBQ's config properly
make sure you set the names of the servers
in lbq to the exact name of the ones you set
in the bungeecord config

QUEUESERVER: "queue"
MAINSERVER: "7b7t"
#set this to false if your a premium server
ENABLEAUTHSERVER: "true"
AUTHSERVER: "auth"    

```
